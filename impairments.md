## What kind of impairments are there? 

Individuals with disabilities exhibit a wide range of diversity, much like those without disabilities, and their impairments also vary significantly. It is crucial to move beyond personal perspectives and understand the diverse ways in which others utilize the web. Recognize that you are not representative of all users. The subsequent section outlines the primary categories of disabilities to consider, along with the special tools they employ to access web content.

> Note: The World Health Organization's [Disability and health](https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/disability-and-health) fact sheet states that "An estimated 1.3 billion people – or 16% of the global population – experience a significant disability today."

### Visual impairments

People with visual impairments may have difficulty seeing the screen, distinguishing colors, or reading small text. Visual impairments include low vision, total blindness and color deficiency, which affects the ability to distinguish between certain colors. To assess color deficiency, the Ishihara Test is commonly used. The Ishihara Test consists of a series of plates containing colored dots and numbers. People with color vision deficiencies may have difficulty identifying the numbers within the plates, indicating the type and severity of their color vision impairment.

### Hearing impairments

Individuals with hearing impairments may have difficulty hearing system sounds, alerts, or multimedia content. This includes individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. To provide access, textual alternatives must be provided. Videos should be manually captioned, and transcripts should be provided for audio content.

> Note: The World Health Organization's [Deafness and hearing loss](https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/deafness-and-hearing-loss) fact sheet states that "Over 5% of the world’s population – or 430 million people – require rehabilitation to address their disabling hearing loss."

### Motor impairments

People with motor impairments may have limited or no control over their hands or fingers, making it challenging to use a keyboard or mouse. Conditions like Parkinson's disease, muscular dystrophy, or spinal cord injuries can result in motor impairments. The way this usually affects web development work is the requirement that controls be accessible by the keyboard.

### Cognitive impairments

Individuals with cognitive impairments may have difficulty with memory, attention, problem-solving, or language processing. This includes conditions like dyslexia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or intellectual disabilities. To create a strong accessibility foundation for individuals with cognitive impairments, it is important to consider the following:

- Providing content through multiple modalities, such as text-to-speech or video, to accommodate different comprehension styles.
- Ensuring that content is easily understandable by adhering to plain-language standards and using clear, straightforward language.
- Directing attention towards crucial information by employing visual cues or highlighting important content.
- Reducing distractions by eliminating unnecessary content or advertisements that may hinder focus and comprehension.
- Maintaining a consistent webpage layout and navigation structure to promote familiarity and ease of use.
- Incorporating familiar design elements, such as underlined links turning blue for unvisited links and purple for visited links, to aid navigation and user understanding.
- Striving for a user-friendly website process (authentication, form completion, ...)
