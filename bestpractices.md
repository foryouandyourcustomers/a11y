# Best Practices Examples
## Keyboard input only:
Navigate a page by using the keyboard only. Useful key combinations to navigate interactive elements:
    "*tab*" - for navigation in descending hierarchical order
    "*ctrl-opt-[arrow-keys]*" - to navigate in desired direction
    "*ctrl-opt-space*" - to activate currently selected element
* **"skip"-link to main content**
Skip links can be useful to minimize the page content to the essential parts of the page.

* **Logical tab order:**
Reach everything that is interactive in an logical order. Dynamic changes in page like when the window gets resized which results in content disappearing or a shopping cart pops up should the cursor is redirected correctly.
