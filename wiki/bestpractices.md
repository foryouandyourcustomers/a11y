# Best Practices Examples

## Keyboard input only:

Navigate a page by using the keyboard only. Useful key combinations to navigate interactive elements:
"_tab_" - for navigation in descending hierarchical order
"_ctrl-opt-[arrow-keys]_" - to navigate in desired direction
"_ctrl-opt-space_" - to activate currently selected element

- **"skip"-link to main content**
  Skip links can be useful to minimize the page content to the essential parts of the page.

- **Logical tab order:**
  Reach everything that is interactive in an logical order. Dynamic changes in page like when the window gets resized which results in content disappearing or a shopping cart pops up should the cursor is redirected correctly.
